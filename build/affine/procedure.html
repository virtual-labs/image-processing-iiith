<b>Affine Transformation - Procedure</b>

<p>The experiments are designed in two parts: </p>

<ol start="1" type="1"><li>Single transformation among three is allowed </li>
<li>Multiple transformations are allowed</li>
</ol><p><b>Single Transformation</b></p>

<ol start="1" type="1"><li>Select image from the mosaic using <i>.select
      image.</i> option</li>
<ol start="1" type="a"><li>Selected region of the image to load it in the
    input image panel </li>
<li>Select appropriate parameters to see the effect </li>
</ol><li>Select .<i>single choice.</i> option</li>
<ol start="1" type="a"><li>Only one transformation is available at a time</li>
<li>Select one choice among three choices: scaling, rotation and
  translation</li>
<li>For rotation and scaling, select interpolation function to see the
  difference in the output. The default choice for interpolation function is
  nearest neighbor.</li>
</ol><li>Select <i>.run.</i> option to see the output under the selected
    parameters</li>
<li>To view the full sized output image, select <i>.view full size
    image.</i></li>
<li>Panel below input and output image panel shows the intermediate results
  obtained during operation. Click on the thumbnails to view images in full
  size.</li>
</ol><p><b>Multiple Transformations</b></p>

<ol start="1" type="1"><li>Select <i>.multiple choice.</i> option</li>
<ol start="1" type="a"><li>Order selection panel will be pop out. Select the
    order in which you want to perform the operation. The order sequence is
    displayed in front of each transformation choice. During operation, edit
    option is provided below in the left panel to change the selected order of
    operation.</li>
<li>All three transformations are allowed under this choice</li>
<li> The interpolation function is kept fixed i.e. nearest neighbor for this
  operation </li>
</ol><li>Select appropriate parameters</li>
<ol start="1" type="a"><li>In case you do not want any particular
    transformation. Do not change parameter of the respective choice</li>
</ol><li>Select the .run. option to perform operations</li>
<li>Output panel and intermediate results panel will display the obtained
  output. </li>
</ol>
