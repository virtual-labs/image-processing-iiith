Introduction</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">In most image processing
tasks, basic operations typically involve modification of a pixel’s
value based on the value of its neighours. A digital image is defined
on a discrete grid of points. Hence there are different ways in which
one can define the spatial relation between pixels. For instance we
could consider two pixels as ‘neighbours’ only if they share one
side/ edge. Alternately, two pixels could be neighbours if they share
a vertex. These two lead to different definitions of neighbourhood
for a pixel. The extent of a neighbourhood is also of interest as it
is useful in finding not only which pixels belong to an object in an
image but also the extent of the object.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The notions of connectivity
and distance between two pixels are useful in defining the
neighborhood for a pixel. Connectivity tells us which pixels are
`next’ to which. It helps answer questions like “Can we reach
pixel p0 from pixel p1?” The concept of connectivity also helps
simplify the definition of region or boundary in an image. Once we
know we can reach p1 from p0, the cost to reach or distance is of
interest. There are different distance metrics and we will study them
in this experiment. </FONT>
