<b>Image Segmentation - Introduction</b>
<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Image segmentation is a common task which arises in many situations 
such as extracting a face or a character in a text from an image before performing automatic recognition. Generally,
 it is used to separate the foreground pixels belonging to the object(s) of interest, from the background pixels. S
 egmentation aims to partition a given image into a set of regions having following properties: connectivity and 
 homogeneity in terms of color or texture. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>An object or region can be a characterized using multiple low-level 
features such as brightness, colour, texture, etc. In this experiment, we will restrict ourselves to objects defined
 by brightness. We will aim to partition a given image into two (foreground and background) and study two techniques namely, 
 histogram-based thresholding and region growing, to perform this partitioning. </span></p>
