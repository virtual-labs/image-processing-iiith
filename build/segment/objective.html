<b>Image Segmentation - Objectives</b>
<p>The broad objective of this experiment is to understand the challenges in extracting objects/regions of 
interest from a given images. Towards this, you will <p>
<ul>
<li>Study the thresholding-based segmentation technique</li>
<ul>
<li>Understand how the threshold can be selected from the image histogram and its effect on segmentation performance</li>
<li>Understand the difference between single and double thresholding</li>

</ul>

<li>Study the region growing technique for segmentation</li>
<ul>
<li>Understand how the seed selection affects segmentation performance</li>
</ul>
