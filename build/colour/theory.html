<p><b>Colour Image Processing: Theory</b></p>


<p>A color
image is represented and stored as a set of three matrices each of size <i>M</i>X<i>N</i>.
Each matrix represents a colour plane. Thus if an RGB model is used, we have a
red image, blue image and a green image and thus 3 corresponding matrices. Other
colour models are also popular in practice.</p>


<p>The RGB
and CMY colour models can be visualized as forming a colour cube shown below.
Here, red, green and blue form the three orthogonal edges of the cube while
cyan, magenta and yellow form the opposite set of edges of the same cube. Note
that the corner (S) where the RGB edges meet corresponds to black colour while
the corner (W) where the CMY edges meet corresponds to the white colour. Any
point within this cube can therefore be specified in terms of 3 coordinates,
namely RGB or CMY values. The diagonal line that connects the black and white points
will correspond to the grayscale.</p>

<p>Relationship
between the RGB and CMY colour model is hence as follows.</p>

<p>Other
colour models separate the colour (chromatic) and intensity (achromatic) information.
The HSI and YCbCr are two such models you will study.</p>

<p><i>HSI
colour model</i>: Here the chromatic information
is represented in two components: hue (H) and <br>
saturation (S), while the achromatic information is represented by the third intensity component
(I). The Hue component represents what we commonly understand to be
colour. It is represented as a point on a circle and hence is specified as an angle
between [0,360] degrees. 0 degree mean red, 120 means green 240 means blue. 60
degrees is yellow, 300 degrees is magenta.</p>

<p>The saturation
component signals the spectral purity of the color, i.e. how much it is diluted
with white color. For example it helps differentiate between sky blue and navy
blue. The value of the saturation component is specified as a number in the
interval [0,1]. </p>


<p>The
HSI model is visualized as a colour spindle (or a double cone) shown below with
white and black forming the two ends of the spindle. As one moves up and down
the spindle, only I value changes so the pixel appears bright or dull but there
is no change in the chromatic content. By contrast, as one moves along the surface
of the cone at a fixed radius, the chromatic content changes. </p>

<p>YCbCr
colour model : This
model represents the chromatic content with two components : </p>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li>Cb - the chrominance of the
     blue difference</li>
 <li>Cr
     - the chrominance of the red difference </li>
</ol>

<p >Finally, the
achromatic component is specified by the Y or the luminosity (roughly the
brightness) component. The
YCbCr color space is widely used for digital videos.</p>

<p >Processing
in the colour domain : </p>

<p >There
are two ways for processing in colour domain</p>

<p >(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scalar processing: Process each
plane of colour model individually. In this processing, one can process only one
or two planes and leave remaining planes unchanged. For example if we want to
modify the red component present in colour image, then modify only red plane
in RGB colour model and leave other planes unchanged. After processing the
image is converted to RGB space for display.</p>

<p >(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; Vector processing : Consider each
pixel of the image as a three element vector, each element corresponding to
information from each of the color planes. Instead of processing the image in
each plane separately , as we did in the previous case. all planes of colour
model are processed simultaneously. </p>
