<p><b>Colour Image Processing: Introduction </b></p>
<p>The
world we perceive is a colourful world and most of the imaging is also in
colour. You will already be familiar with the notion of 3 primary colours,
namely, Red, Green and Blue. This is an additive colour model, since any colour
can be represented as a weighted sum of the 3 primary colours. When all the
three are present in equal proportion then we obtain the white colour. Most
imaging devices such as cameras, acquire 3 images (colour planes), one for each
of these primary colours. Likewise all display devices use the primary colour
model for their input. </p>
<p>In
contrast to the above are devices such as printers which use a different set of
colours : Cyan, Magenta and Yellow. This is a subtractive model since any
colour is created by subtracting weighted combinations of the above 3 colours
from white. Thus, to create black colour, we need white- (cyan + magenta +
yellow).</p>
<p>The
early approach to colour image processing problem focussed on which colour
model should be used and if the processing can/should be done on every colour
plane. Both these choices affect the result of processing. These approaches
treat a colour image as composed of 3 greyscale images, i.e. three images with every
pixel being a scalar. This approach has some limitations which you will study
in your experiment. The recent trend has been to treat the colour image as an
image where every pixel is a 3-D vector.</p>
<p>In this
experiment, you will study a) the different colour models and b) the effect of
processing colour images by considering them as composed of three colour
planes. Specifically, you will experiment and find out the appropriateness of
different colour models for enhancement and the effect of processing <u>all or
one</u> of the planes of the input image, on the output image.</p>
