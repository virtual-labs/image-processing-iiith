			<p>1. In film photography there is a notion of positive and negative. For digital images, what is an appropriate transformation function to obtain a negative image i.e. black becomes white and vice versa? 
</p><p>
			2. In the window operation you studied in the experiment, the slope of the mapping function was always positive within the window. What is the effect on the output image if this slope was negative?
</p><p>
			3. Develop a solution using window operation to process the given image and retain, in the processed output, only the small, dark mountain region. Can you do the same for the dull, bigger mountain ? (on the below image)</p>
