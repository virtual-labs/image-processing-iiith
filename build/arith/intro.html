<b> Image Arithmetic - Introduction </b>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p>
	In image arithmetic, we consider operations such as I(x,y) = A (x,y) o B(x,y) where o is an arithmetic operation such as addition, subtraction,
	multiplication or division. Here, A and B could be derived from different sources. Such operations are particularly used in modelling image acquisition
	as a result of a perfect image corrupted with (additive or multiplicative) noise. The noise is often introduced either by a transmission medium or the
	camera.
